User (UserID, UserEmail, UserName)

  - The User table references users of the application, and is therefore named User.
  - The User table doesn't reference other tables but both other tables reference User, as a User has both tasks and priorities.

Task (TaskID, UserID, PriorityID, TaskDueDate, TaskTitle, TaskCreationDate, TaskDescription, TaskCompleted)
  Foreign Key: UserID references User
  Foreign Key: PriorityID references Priority

  - The Task table represents the actual tasks in the User's to-do list.
  - Each task references a User (the user that has that task) and a Priority (how important that task is).
  - The DueDate, Title, CreationDate, Description, and Completed columns are attributes attached to the task entity which are fairly self-explanatory.

Priority (PriorityID, UserID, PriorityTitle, PriorityType, PriorityNumber)
  Foreign Key: UserID references User

  - The Priority table represents custom priority levels that each user has created.
  - Each User can create several priorities. Each Task is assigned one of these Priorities.
  - Each Priority is given a PriorityID and UserID to identyify it.
  - The Priority is given a PriorityTitle that the User uses to identify it.
  - Each Priority has a PriorityType, that is Day, Week, Month, or Year. This refers to how far in advance the user will be notified of the task
  - Each Priority has a number, which is how many of its type the user will be notified for before the Task due date.
  - An example of type and month is the following: A priority with type 'Week' and Number 2, will be on a user's to-do list for two weeks before the due date of the task.
