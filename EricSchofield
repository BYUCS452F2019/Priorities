	I have been envisioning a planning system that would achieve something like this for years, and the automatic daily task list generation is a huge part of it. I would love to join because I think it is useful and I would use it. I also think it should be fairly straightforward to build the database for it, and we can make a simple, clean UI. It makes sense to set up as an LLC, and I like the business model. Another option for revenue could be to unlock premium features for paid users (e.g., unlimited tasks, greater customizations, or even more if it extends to more than just a to-do list). 
    
	I have experience with iOS apps (and minimal Android—just in school), so I would feel very comfortable in that realm. I have also used Firebase quite a bit, so I’m familiar with setting that up (especially in an iOS app). I would really like to get my hands dirty with the backend, though, because that is something I want to become better at than I currently am. As for the backend, I am totally open to the language and technologies used.
