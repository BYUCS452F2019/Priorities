# Priorities
Create personal, prioritized to-do lists

# Project Description

The Goal of Priorities is to make daily to-do lists based on user inputted criteria.

The user can input tasks with titles, descriptions, and due-dates.
The user can also create levels of priority for tasks and assign tasks these different levels.
The user can also add re-curring tasks.

Once the user adds tasks and priority levels, the tasks will show up in the users dashboard (or wherever).

The dashboard will display tasks due that day, and will also display tasks due on future dates.
The future tasks displayed are based on priority level, and the user can choose how far in advance to show tasks based on priority level.

# SQL

I was wanting to use MySQL, but am open to ideas.
I am thinking that we will need 3-4 database tables; mainly right now I think: users, priorities, and tasks will be tables.

# NoSQL

I was thinking about using firebase or mongoDB as the NoSQL database but am open to ideas.

# Languages
I'm fine building the app with a python, php, or java Back-end and doing either a web-app or mobile app.
The Front-end can either be android, iOS, or reactnative if we decide for a mobile app.
Or the front-end can be angular, vue, or reactjs for a webapp.
